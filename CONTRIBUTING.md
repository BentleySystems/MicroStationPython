# Contributing to iTwin.js

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to the MicroStation Python repository!

There are many ways to contribute.
The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

## Asking Questions

Have a question?
Rather than opening an issue, please ask away on [MicroStation Programming Forum](https://bentleysystems.service-now.com/community?id=community_forum&sys_id=20103f06475e31109091861f536d4321).

The community will be eager to assist you. Your well-worded question will serve as a resource to others searching for help.


## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in the Python binding?
Have a feature request?
We want to hear about it!
Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [MicroStation Programming Forum](https://bentleysystems.service-now.com/community?id=community_forum&sys_id=20103f06475e31109091861f536d4321) or [Issues](https://github.com/BentleySystems/MicroStationPython/issues)to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

If you find that your issue already exists, please add relevant comments and your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments).
Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

- üëç - upvote
- üëé - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request.
Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input.
Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue:

- A short description of the issue that becomes the title
- Versions of relevant iTwin.js packages
- Minimal steps to reproduce the issue or a code snippet that demonstrates the issue
- What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw
- Images that help explain the issue
- Any relevant error messages, logs, or other details
- Impact of the issue
- Use the [`bug`](https://github.com/BentleySystems/MicroStationPython/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug) or [`enhancement`](https://github.com/BentleySystems/MicroStationPython/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug+label%3Aenhancement) label to identify the type of issue you are filing

Don't feel bad if the developers can't reproduce the issue right away.
They will simply ask for more information!

### Follow Your Issue

You may be asked to clarify things or try different approaches, so please follow your issue and be responsive.
