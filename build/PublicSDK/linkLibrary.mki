# The purpose of this file is to allow MKE files to produce shared or static libraries without
# each one having the same branch for dlmlink vs. creatlib. Linking a static library needs a subset
# of parameters from linking a shared library, so callers of this file should pretend they are
# linking a shared library (e.g. as if they are using dlmlink and defining the DLM_ family of
# variables) and if doing a static build, this file will carry over the required values for static
# linking.

    %error linkLibrary requires the following dlmlink-based variables to be defined, so it can carry them over to creatlib: DLM_NAME, DLM_DEST, DLM_OBJECT_FILES, DLM_CONTEXT_LOCATION
